# Vue MdBootstrap Demos

Here are some examples of **Vue MdBootstrap** capabilities. This demo is still work in progress,
please be patient until I completely write examples of each component.

## How to run

Create directory `mdbootstrap-demo` under your apache web-root folder. Clone this demos to 
the directory you've created. While still in the project directory, runs commands below:
```shell script
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Wait till the demos is finish compiled. Then you can point your browser to the address
`http://localhost/mdbootstrap-demo`.

Oh, btw, u can make this demos as your own playground too. Have a nice try.
